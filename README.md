How to Run the Weather Advisor App

1. üîß Preparation

Before you can use the Weather Advisor app, make sure you:
	‚Ä¢	Have Python installed (version 3.7 or higher).
	‚Ä¢	Are using an environment that supports Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., Google Colab, VS Code with Jupyter extension, or JupyterLab).
	‚Ä¢	Have an internet connection (the app fetches live weather data from the wttr.in API).

‚∏ª

2. üìÅ Open the Notebook
	1.	Locate the starter notebook file that has been renamed (as per your course instructions).
	‚Ä¢	For example, weather_advisor_ankush.ipynb.
	2.	Open the notebook using:
	‚Ä¢	Google Colab: Right-click the file > ‚ÄúOpen with‚Äù > ‚ÄúGoogle Colab‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	VS Code: Open VS Code > Open Folder > Select the notebook file
	‚Ä¢	JupyterLab: Launch JupyterLab > Navigate to the file > Double click to open

‚∏ª

3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Notebook

Once the notebook is open:
	1.	Run All Cells (Top to Bottom):
	‚Ä¢	In Google Colab: Click Runtime > Run all
	‚Ä¢	In JupyterLab/VS Code: Click Run or press Shift + Enter on each code cell
üîπ The first cell contains !pip install pyinputplus. This will install the required library. Allow it to finish before moving on.


üå§Ô∏è Start the App

After running all cells, the final block of code contains:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = WeatherInterface()
    app.run()

  This launches your Weather Advisor App in the notebook interface.

5. üß≠ Using the App ‚Äì Menu Options

You‚Äôll be presented with a menu like:## üìì Submission Checklist
Choose an option:
1. Set Location
2. Current Weather
3. Ask a Question
4. View Forecast
5. Visualizations
6. Exit

   Example Workflow:
	1.	Set Location: Choose this to enter a city name (e.g., Paris, New York). This fetches weather data for the location.
	2.	Current Weather: Displays live weather stats for your chosen city.
	3.	Ask a Question: Type questions like:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWill it rain tomorrow?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the temperature today in London?‚Äù
	4.	View Forecast: Shows a 5-day forecast for your location.
	5.	Visualizations:
	‚Ä¢	Choose Temperature Trends, Precipitation Forecast, or Both to see charts.
	6.	Exit: Closes the app gracefully.

6. ‚ùó Tips for Success
	‚Ä¢	Use meaningful location names (city or town).
	‚Ä¢	Type questions naturally for the best AI-generated answers.
	‚Ä¢	If weather data doesn‚Äôt load, try a different city or check your internet connection.
