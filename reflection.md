# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
I primarily used ChatGPT to help direct my coding and problem-solving for this project. It was quite helpful in decomposing difficult jobs into smaller, more doable pieces. I would ask ChatGPT for advice whenever I was unsure of how to organise a class or apply a particular feature. It assisted me in understanding how to use third-party libraries such as pyinputplus for handling user input and matplotlib for graphs. I also saved a tonne of time because the tool provided me with suggestions on how to make the code more modular and clean.

## Prompting Techniques
I discovered that giving clear instructions had a significant impact. A more focused inquiry would be, "How can I extract average temperatures from this API response?" or "Can you help me build a function that visualises rainfall over five days?" as opposed to something more general like, "How do I build a weather app?" Upon generating code, I also requested enhancements, such as "Now make it use classes" or "Can you make it user-friendly?" This back and forth enabled me to develop the concept in a more methodical manner.


## What Worked Well?
My favourite feature is the natural language question feature. The application provides a concise response to queries such as "Will it rain tomorrow in Paris?" The software felt much more dynamic and practical as a result, in my opinion. In order to keep things organised, I also divided the code into several classes, each of which handled a distinct task, such as retrieving data, processing the query, or creating graphs.

## What Would You Do Differently?
If I had more time, I would try to make the app better at comprehending user enquiries. Simple keyword matching is its current foundation, and it isn't always reliable. It might be considerably more intelligent if it used a true natural language processing library like spaCy. Currently, the app doesn't provide excellent feedback if the API is unavailable or a location isn't recognised. I would also enhance error handling. The application may become more user-friendly if a graphical user interface (GUI) is added rather than a console.

## Final Thoughts
All things considered, this assignment was an excellent educational opportunity. I became more proficient with Python, gained knowledge of working with APIs, and became more at ease with organising an entire application. Throughout the project, using ChatGPT helped me remain on course and provided me with ideas that I wouldn't have come up with on my own. I'm happy with the app's outcome and feel more comfortable taking on related tasks in the future.
